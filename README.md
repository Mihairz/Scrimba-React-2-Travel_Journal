## Travel Journal
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>

Scrimba's immersive frontend course guides learners through key concepts, with solo projects after each section.<br> 
This is the __second section's final project__, that focused on teaching about *__React components'props and mapping through data coming from an object (like mocking a response from a database)__*. <br>
Therefore, __Travel Journal__ showcases a web page that renders a reusable React component for each entry, with its specific data.
